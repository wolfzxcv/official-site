In practical applications, you may find that your trading decisions based on the results of rigorous technical analysis are opposite to the direction of price fluctuations in the real market. This situation does not contradict our original intention for technical analysis, nor does it mean that your technical analysis method is wrong.',

  justUnderstanding:
    'Just understanding the chart price does not help us make trading decisions, you also need to understand how to identify the price trend on the chart. There are three types of chart trends: up, down, and consolidation. In the unilateral trend of rising and falling, people often adopt a breakthrough trading strategy, that is, only trade in one direction, buying up or down. In a consolidation trend, people often use a range trading strategy of selling high and buying low, selling when the price rises to the top of the consolidation range, and buy when the price falls to the bottom of the consolidation range. Therefore, it is particularly important for traders to judge whether the exchange rate trend is in a unilateral trend of up/down or in a consolidation interval trend. Only by accurately grasping the trend can we adopt the correct trading method as far as possible.',

  aSupportLine:
    '—> A support line refers to a line connected by a series of supporting prices. If the exchange rate once fell to this price level and turned back many times, we consider it a price with a support line. The more occasions price touch and return from this line,the more reliable the support is.',

  onTheMT4:
    'On the MT4 platform, we can find tools for drawing trend lines on the toolbar above the platform.',
  thePrincipleOf:
    'The principle of drawing a trend line is to find the relevant highest and lowest points in the upward (downward) trend in the time period under consideration, and connect them with a straight line, where the price cannot cross the trend line. The longer the trend line drawn, the stronger the force represented, and the greater the possibility that the price will fall (rise) and return near the trend line.',

  fundamentalAnalysisOverview: 'Fundamental analysis overview',
  technicalAnalysisStudies:
    'Technical analysis studies historical prices, and traders can make trading decisions only by focusing on charts and prices. Fundamental analysis looks more complicated. It studies the core elements that affect a country’s economy and currency exchange rate changes. It aims to predict changes in foreign exchange prices in a certain economic cycle by analyzing a series of economic indicators, government decisions and eventually market trend.',
  technicalAnalysisReveals:
    'Technical analysis reveals the balance of power between buyers and sellers in the foreign exchange market, while fundamentals analyze the market from the source of exchange rate changes: currency capital flows and trade flows, news and economic conditions.',
  theFactorsAffecting:
    'The factors affecting exchange rate changes involve many aspects such as society, economy and politics. As a result, fundamental analysis may need to incorporate a lot of analysis elements. This problem restricts many beginners in fundamental analysis because of the highly dynamic market fundamentals. Staying sensitive at all times is not easy. But don’t worry, as you deepen your research on fundamental analysis, the concepts in the global dynamic economy will form a picture in your mind. The short-term changes in market fundamentals are just constantly changing this picture.',
  ofCourse:
    'Of course, fundamental analysis is not aimed at the exact market price. For example, when analyzing a country’s employment report, we can have a relatively clear understanding of the country’s overall economic conditions, but if we want to obtain specific trading strategies such as entry points and exit points, we still need to use technical analysis methods. For this reason,many traders may choose to abandon fundamental analysis completely and rely solely on technical analysis in particular when they are at a loss by using a large amount of fundamental information. This is a wrong approach. Trading without a certain understanding of fundamental factors is like a blind person touching an elephant. The price information you see on a chart may not be the truth of the market.',
  longTerm: 'Long-term analysis in fundamentals：',
  whenMeasuringCurrencys:
    'When measuring currency value, long-term fundamentals use two classic analysis methods: purchasing power parity theory and international balance of payments theory.',
  purchasingPower: 'Purchasing power parity theory',
  purchasingPowerParity:
    'Purchasing power parity theory states that the exchange rate of two currencies should be equal to the ratio of the price levels of a basket of goods and services in these two countries. This is because if the actual prices of a group of goods in two countries are quite different, assuming that the transportation cost is zero, traders can make profits by buying and selling.',
  exchangeRate:
    'Exchange rate = commodity price in one country / commodity price in another country',
  forExample:
    'For example: a can of Coke costs 1 u.s dollar in the United States and 100 yen in Japan. According to the purchasing power parity theory, the exchange rate = u.s Coke cost / Japanese Coke cost = 1:100',
  ifTheCurrent:
    'If the current exchange rate is 1:110, according to the purchasing power parity theory, the yen is undervalued and the dollar is overvalued. Traders can buy goods in Japan for 100 yen and then transport them to the United States to sell them for 1 u.s dollar. The resulting u.s dollars will be converted into 110 yen at the current exchange rate, with a risk-free arbitrage of 10 yen. Therefore, the demand for the yen will rise， which will eventually boost the appreciation of the yen and the depreciation of the u.s dollar. The exchange rate of the u.s dollar against the yen will return to the 1:100 level.',
  itShouldBeNoted:
    'It should be noted that Coke is just an example to illustrate the meaning of the theory. In fact, the purchasing power parity theory is not based on a single commodity, but a basket of commodities and services. The combination of commodities and services depends on the preferences of different analysts. At the same time, the purchasing power parity theory ignores some important factors affecting prices, including transportation costs, trade barriers, tariffs, etc., and it does not specify data on non-traded goods. Purchasing power parity theory is generally only applicable to long-term forecasts over 3 to 5 years.',
  balanceOfPayments: 'Balance of Payments Theory',
  accordingToThe:
    'According to the theory of international balance of payments, two main factors affect exchange rate changes: trade flows and capital flows, that is, the current account and capital account in the balance of payments.',
  theCurrentAccount:
    "The current account reflects the import and export of goods and services in a country. When exports are greater than imports, the country is a net exporter. This means that more people buy the currency of the country than selling, because other countries need to buy the currency of that country when they import goods from this country, and the demand for that country's currency will increase. Therefore, countries with a trade surplus have more opportunities for currency appreciation. The opposite is a net importer country. Imports are greater than exports. Importers in a net importer country need to sell their own currency to exchange for the currency of the exporting countries, which will depreciate their own currency.",
  theCapitalAccount:
    "The capital account reflects the inflow and outflow of investment capital in a country. If the net capital account value is positive, it means that the capital inflow is greater than outflow. For foreign investors, they need to convert their own currency into domestic currency. Therefore, a positive capital account will increase the demand for a country's currency and promote its appreciation. Conversely, if the capital account is negative, it means that the capital inflow is less than the outflow. Domestic investors need to convert their own currencies into other currencies, and then suppress the value of their domestic currencies.",
  capitalFlows:
    'Capital flows can be divided into two types according to capital forms: entity flows and portfolio flows. Entity flow refers to foreign direct investment. They will first convert their funds into the currency of the investing country, causing the currency of the investing country to appreciate. The portfolio flow is further divided into stocks and fixed income (such as bonds).',
  whenACountry:
    'When a country’s stock market is positive, it indicates that capital is flowing into the stock market, and foreign capital will also be attracted, thereby boosting the value of the local currency. When a country’s stock market is in a downward trend, it indicates that capital is withdrawing from the market, and foreign capital is also withdrawn, which is detrimental to the value of the local currency. Therefore, foreign exchange traders can follow the performance of global stock markets to predict the capital flow of countries in a relatively long-term.',
  theFixedIncomeMarket:
    'The fixed income market is similar to the stock market. The higher the rate of return, the more conducive to the appreciation of the national currency. The difference is that when the global economy is unstable, the stable and safe characteristics of the fixed-income market serve as a refuge for global capital. Long-term traders should pay attention to the spreads in the fixed income market:',
  detectCurrency:
    '1. Detect currency spreads-European Interbank Offered Rates and Eurodollars',
  investorsCanPay:
    'Investors can pay attention to the difference between the European Interbank Offered Rate and the Eurodollar. European Interbank Offered Rates are fixed income assets that reflect European short-term interest rates. Eurodollars refer to u.s dollar deposits placed in banks outside the United States. Because the United States and Europe have the most comprehensive fixed income and stock markets, if European Interbank Offered Rates are higher than Eurodollar deposit rates, it will drive investors to sell US assets and buy foreign assets, which will have a certain impact on the foreign exchange market. On the contrary, if the positive gap between the European Interbank Offered Rate and the Eurodollar narrows, that is, the interest rate of the European Interbank Offered Rate will decrease, the attractiveness of European assets will decrease, driving investors to sell European assets.',
  theFixedIncome:
    '2. The fixed income gap across Europe-Gilts bonds, European Interbank Offered Rates and Eurodollars',
  giltsBonds:
    "Gilts bonds are fixed income products issued by the British government. When buying and selling the British pound against the US dollar and the euro against the British pound, you need to pay attention to the gap between Gilts bonds, European Interbank Offered Rates and Eurodollars. When the positive gap between the UK interest rate and the European or US interest rate drops, the UK's fixed income investment opportunities will be less attractive to foreign investors. Investors will sell their specific assets in the pound to find other investment opportunities with higher returns, putting pressure on the pound to give up.",
  otherCountriesInternational:
    '3. Other countries-international fixed income markets',
  theFixedIncomeProducts:
    'The fixed income products of the United States, the United Kingdom, and countries outside Europe and their interest gaps are also worth watching. For example, Australia and New Zealand have implemented high interest rates, which make investors sell their local currency to buy Australian dollars or New Zealand dollars. This activity will become more pronounced when interest rates in other countries fall. Conversely, if interest rates in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe rise, funds may be transferred from Australia and New Zealand, adding upward pressure on their own currencies.',
  weAlsoNeed:
    "We also need to consider more factors when considering medium and long-term fundamentals. For example, when analyzing the long-term trend of the US dollar, it is necessary to consider various aspects such as the Fed's monetary and interest rate policies, the US economic situation, and the impact of world geopolitical events on the US. At this time, news is particularly important. You can learn about the economic performance of a country in the past period of time and the currency and interest rate policies that the country is adopting in the past data news, and use this to speculate on the currency of the country in the future. trend. Therefore, for the accuracy and comprehensiveness of fundamental analysis, even if you are not trading news, you should keep your eyes on the important economic indicators in the economic calendar.",

  ifYouFind:
    'If you find a wave of uptrend or downtrend that has just ended on a chart (the rule of 123 can be used to determine whether the trend is over, please refer to the Novice Academy "Technical Analysis and Trend Judgment" for details), you can consider starting with Fibonacci retracement line to determine the next support or resistance.',

  supportLevel:
    'Support level refers to the support price that the exchange rate may encounter when it falls, so as to stop the fall and stabilize the price. Another corresponding concept is the resistance level, which is the ceiling when the exchange rate rises, reversing to a falling price. It is necessary to identify support and resistance levels, because when the exchange rate approaches or effectively breaks through the support and resistance levels, it is a good time to trade. When the breakout fails, people often think that the original trend may remain the same, and when the exchange rate effectively breaks through the support/resistance level, it is very likely to trigger a new wave of down/up trend.',
  theMethods:
    'The methods to identify support and resistance levels mainly include trend line, previous high/low, pattern judgment and technical indicator judgment.',
  trendline: 'Trendline',
  weIntroduced:
    'In "Technical Analysis and Trend Judgment", we introduced how to draw trend lines. In fact, the trend line is a way of judging support and resistance levels: the trend line in the rising market is composed of a series of support levels. When the exchange rate falls back to near the trend line, the support level on the trend line is very likely to support the exchange rate. The trend line in the falling market is composed of a series of resistance levels. When the exchange rate rises near thetrend line, the resistance level on the trend line is very likely to cause the exchange rate to fall again. Therefore, trend lines are a common way to determine support and resistance levels in trending markets.',

    'The above picture shows the previous high and the previous low on the AUD/CAD daily chart.',
  whenJudgingSupport:
    'When judging support and resistance levels, people think that the previous high may be the resistance level of the subsequent uptrend, and the previous low may be the support level of the subsequent downtrend. Because the exchange rate once returned to the previous high, when the price moves to the vicinity of this price level again, it may return again, and the case for previous low is similar.',
  whenThePrice:
    'When the price returns to the previous low or the previous high repeatedly, the more the number of returns, the stronger the support or resistance of the price. If the currency market successfully breaks the support level and changes the trend, the original strong support level is likely to turn into a strong resistance level in the subsequent market movement or vice versa.',
