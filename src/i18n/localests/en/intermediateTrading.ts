    'In the market, buyers and sellers are playing power games all the time, and the chart is a record of the results of this game. People gradually found some typical chart patterns on the charts. With the help of them, people can clearly see whether the buyer is dominant or the seller is strong in the market. Moreover, with these classic patterns appearing time and time again, people find that the same changes in the power of buyers and sellers always appear in the market. Therefore, we can use the experience of learning patterns to predict the trend of the market outlook. This is pattern analysis.',

    'Top and Head and Shoulders Bottom The head and shoulders pattern is one of the most valued by traders and one of the most common inverted patterns.

  whenThePriceRisesAnd:
    'When the price rises and falls back to a fixed point, a peak is formed, which looks like a left shoulder. The price then rebounded again and created a peak higher than the previous peak, and then fell back to the support level of the first peak. The new peak is called the "head" and the support level is called the "neckline".If the pattern is fully formed, the price will rebound at the neckline and create a lower peak, which is the right shoulder.',
  whenYouFindAHeadAnd:

  moreCautiousTraders:
    'More cautious traders may be inclined to wait for the price to retest the neckline (that is, the price touches the neckline again), and then enter the market when the price fails to break the neckline upwards. Of course, sometimes the price may start to go down directly after breaking the neckline without looking back. Whether you choose to trade more cautiously depends on traders further observation of the market.',

    'After the trade is opened, the profit target is usually set as the distance in points from the head to the neckline.',
  inAdditionYouMaySometimes:
    'In addition, you may sometimes encounter a head-and-shoulders bottom pattern. The head-and-shoulders bottom tends to appear at the end of a wave of downtrend and means that the future price increase is more likely. The head and shoulders bottom consists of a trough, followed by a lower bottom and a higher trough. Similar to the head and shoulders, the entry timing of the head and shoulders is when you confirm that the neckline is broken by the price, or wait to see if the neckline will be backtested.',

The double top pattern consists of two peaks next to each other, and the prices of the two peaks are similar. The neckline of the pattern is at the support level formed by the price. When the price breaks below the support level, the neckline, we believe that the pattern has formed.',
  nTermsOfTheTimingOfEntry:
    'n terms of the timing of entry, you can generally consider opening a sell position when the price falls below the neckline, or waiting for the price to retest the neckline and form a lower peak. Once the backtest fails, it often means that the price is moving The motivation is stronger.',
  theProfitTargetIsSetAtThe:
    'The profit target is set at the point distance from the top to the neckline.',
  theReverseOfADoubleTop:
    'The reverse of a double top pattern is a double bottom pattern, which often appears at the end of a downtrend, consisting of two low troughs next to each other, and the bottom prices are similar. The appearance of a double bottom often means that an upward trend will begin next. Similarly, we can either enter the market when the neckline is broken, or wait for the neckline to fail back testing and form a higher bottom to enter the market. Failure to test the neckline back means that the price upward momentum is stronger.',
  flagPattern: 'flag pattern',
  theFlagPatternIsDifferent:

This feature can help you lock in profits and automatically manage your transactions. For example, you can specify that whenever the price rises by 5 points, your stop loss will move up by 5 points. When you cannot manage the transaction in real time, trailing stop loss can help you automatically realize the above-mentioned position management. When the price starts to fluctuate in the opposite direction, the stop loss will remain at the original price. When the market price reaches the stop loss price, your position will be automatically closed-trailing stop loss is an effective strategy to reduce losses.',
